  A logged in staff user can filter retrieved case notes for an existing offender booking

    And case note test harness initialized

  Scenario Outline: Retrieve case notes
    When case notes are requested for offender booking "<bookingId>"
    Then "<number>" case notes are returned
    And case note types match "<case note types>"
    And case note sub types match "<case note sub types>"

    Examples:
      | bookingId | number | case note types                                                 | case note sub types                                             |

  Scenario Outline: Retrieve filtered case notes
    When case note type "<case note type>" filter applied
    And case note sub type "<case note sub type>" filter applied
    And date from "<date from>" filter applied
    And date to "<date to>" filter applied
    And pagination with limit "<limit>" and offset "<offset>" applied
    And filtered case notes are requested for offender booking "<bookingId>"
    Then "<number>" case notes are returned
    And "<total>" case notes are available

    Examples:
      | bookingId | case note type | case note sub type | date from  | date to    | limit | offset | number | total |
